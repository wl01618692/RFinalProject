# R_FinalProject
This repo contains my final project of STA32 that I wrote back in my second year. This project is first written in R and the report is written in Rmarkdown. This project aims to be an introduction in R and Rmarkdown. It pratices my R skill by utilizing vector, random generator, coin flip simulatior, large sample simulation, linear regression, QQ plot, graph plotting, confidence interval.
