# R Final Project
This repo contains my final project of one of the statistics class that I wrote back in my second year. This project is written in Rmarkdown and R and aims to be an introduction in R and Rmarkdown. It pratices my R skill by utilizing vector, random generator, coin flip simulatior, large sample simulation, linear regression, QQ plot, graph plotting, confidence interval.

I will not release any information about the course (prompt and requirement) to prevent any academy misconduct.
